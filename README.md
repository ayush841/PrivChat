# PrivChat
It's an android application that uses the AWS RealTime Database to provide instant messaging services between users.
The main motive of this app is to create a session between the users to exchange messages and then delete the session as both users exit the session and also delete the messages.
Currently the session and encrpytion part is yet to be implemented.
There is a bug which doesn't display the message and the app crashes.
